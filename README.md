# Python Code for Computer Programming

This repository contains the source code for a Python-based code used in computer programming assignments and problems.

## Running the Code
To run the code, use the following command:

```sh
python filename.py
```

To run the code with an input file, use the following command:
```sh
python filename.py < (PATH_TO_INPUT.TXT)
```

Replace `filename.py` with the actual script name and specify the correct path to your input file.
